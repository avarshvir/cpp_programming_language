A structure is a user-defined data type in C/C++. 
A structure creates a data type that can be used to group items of possibly 
different types into a single type. 

Structures in C++ can contain two types of members:  

Data Member: These members are normal C++ variables. We can create a structure with 
variables of different data types in C++.
Member Functions: These members are normal C++ functions. Along with variables, we 
can also include functions inside a structure declaration.

we cannot initialize value inside structure in C but in C++ it is possible.
