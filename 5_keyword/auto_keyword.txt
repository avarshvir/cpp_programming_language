n C++, auto is a keyword used for type inference, introduced in the C++11 standard.
When you use auto to declare a variable, the compiler deduces the type of that variable 
based on its initializer.

For example:

cpp
auto x = 10; // 'x' is deduced to be of type int
auto y = 3.14; // 'y' is deduced to be of type double
auto z = "Hello"; // 'z' is deduced to be of type const char*
