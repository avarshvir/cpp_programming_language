Algorithm: Steps

Certainly, here are the steps for using recursion in a function, presented concisely:

Base Case: It defines a termination condition that stops the recursion.
Recursive Case: It expresses the problem in terms of smaller instances of itself.
Implement Function: It writes the function with base case and recursive case.
Adjust Parameters: It modifies input parameters to simplify the problem.
Return Results: It provides a result in the base case(s).
Handle Intermediates: It processes intermediate results if needed.
Manage Call Stack: Understand how frames are pushed and popped.
Test and Debug: Verify correctness and debug if necessary.
Optimize (if needed): Improve efficiency using techniques like memoization or tail recursion.
Call Function: Invoke the recursive function with initial inputs.
