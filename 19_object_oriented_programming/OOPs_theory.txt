Object Oriented Programming is a paradigm that provides many concepts such as 
inheritance, data binding, polymorphism etc.

The programming paradigm where everything is represented as an object is known 
as truly object-oriented programming language. Smalltalk is considered as the first 
truly object-oriented programming language.

Object-oriented programming â€“ As the name suggests uses objects in programming. 
Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, 
hiding, polymorphism, etc. in programming. The main aim of OOP is to bind together 
the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code 
can access this data except that function.

There are some basic concepts that act as the building blocks of OOPs i.e.

Class
Objects
Encapsulation
Abstraction
Polymorphism
Inheritance
Dynamic Binding
Message Passing
